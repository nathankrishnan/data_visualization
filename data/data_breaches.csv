It discovered the intrusion mid-December 2006. Transaction data from 2003 as well as mid-May through December 2006 may have been accessed. According to its Web site, TJX is the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide.Note on our total: included in this breach are 45,700,000 credit and debit card account numbers; 455,000 merchandise return records containing customer names and driver's license numbers; recovery of about 200,000 stolen credit card account numbers; records then 1indicated an additional 48 million people have been affected. Totals were estimated at 94 million but now seem to have affected over 100 million accounts.UPDATE  (2/22/2007):TJX said that while it first thought the intrusion took place from May 2006 to January 2007, it now thinks its computer system was also hacked in July 2005 and on various subsequent dates that year.UPDATE (3/21/2007): Information stolen from TJX's systems was being used fraudulently in November 2006 in an $8 million gift card scheme, one month before TJX officials said they learned of the breach, according to Florida law enforcement officials. UPDATE  (3/29/2007): The company reported in its SEC filing that 45.7 million credit and debit card numbers were hacked, along with 455,000 merchandise return records containing customers' driver's license numbers, Military ID numbers or Social Security numbers. UPDATE (4/22/2007): Initially, TJX said the break-in started seven months before it was discovered. Then, on Feb. 18, the company noted the perpetrators had access to data for 17 months, and apparently began in July 2005. UPDATE (04/26/2007): Three states' banking associations (MA, CT, and ME) filed a class action lawsuit against TJX to recover the costs of damages totaling tens of millions of dollars incurred for replacing customers' debit and credit cards. UPDATE (05/04/2007): An article in the WSJ notes that because TJX had an outdated wireless security encryption system, had failed to install firewalls and data encryption on computers using the wireless network, and had not properly install another layer of security software it had bought, thieves were able to access data streaming between hand-held price-checking devices, cash registers and the store's computers. 21 U.S. and Canadian lawsuits seek damages from the retailer for reissuing compromised cards. UPDATE (07/10/2007): U.S. Secret Service agents found TJX customers' credit card numbers in the hands of Eastern European cyber thieves who created high-quality counterfeit credit cards. Victims are from the U.S., Europe, Asia and Canada, among other places, Several Cuban nationals in Florida were arrested with more than 200,000 credit card account numbers. UPDATE (08/31/2007): The U.S. Secret Service Agency earlier this week said it has arrested and indicted four members of an organized fraud ring in South Florida, charging each of them with aggravated identity theft, counterfeit credit-card trafficking, and conspiracy. UPDATE (09/21/2007): A ring leader in the TJX Cos.-linked credit card fraud, was sentenced to five years in prison and has been ordered to pay nearly $600,000 in restitution for damages resulting from stolen financial information. UPDATE (09/25/2007): TJX announced the terms of a settlement for customers affected by the data breach -- with strings attached. Credit monitoring will be offered to about 455,000 of the 46 million affected. TJX will reimburse customers who had to replace driver's licenses as a result of the breach if they submit documentation for the time and money spent on replacing licenses. The company will give a $30 store voucher to those customers who submit documentation about their lost time and money. And TJX will hold a special 3-day sale with a 15% discount sometime in 2008. The settlement still needs to be approved by the court. UPDATE (10/23/2007): Court filings in a case brought by banks against TJX say the number of accounts affected by the thefts topped 94 million. UPDATE (10/23/2007): The total number of records increased from 167 million to 215 million. Recent court filings in a case brought by banks against TJX say the number of accounts affected by the thefts topped 94 million, up considerably from 45,7 million credit and debit card account numbers initially thought to be compromised. Breach costs have been estimated at $216 million. UPDATE (11/30/2007): Fifth Third Bancorp, the Ohio bank that was fined $880,000 by Visa for its role in the customer data security breach at TJX Cos., the largest ever, also paid fines and compensation totaling $1.4 million following the loss of data from BJ's Wholesale Club Inc. UPDATE (12/05/2007): An InternetNews.com article estimates TJX expenses at $500 million to $1 billion. In a settlement with VISA USA, TJX will pay a maximum of $40.9 million to fund an alternative recovery payments program for customers affected by the breach. At least 19 lawsuits have been filed, and there are investigations underway by the Federal Trade Commission and 37 state Attorneys General. UPDATE (12/18/2007): TJX has settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount.Although both sides said the settlement total would remain confidential, TJX said the costs were covered by a $107 million reserve that it set aside against its second-quarter earnings.TJX also has said that $107 million would cover the costs of another breach agreement: a Nov. 30 deal with Visa Inc. to help pay a maximum $40.9 million to help the network's card-issuing banks recover expenses to replace customers' Visa cards. UPDATE (2/10/2008): Notices are going out to millions of customers who may have had credit card information compromised in a data breach. The notices contain information about eligibility for compensation such as vouchers and credit monitoring to be provided under a proposed settlement. UPDATE (4/2/2008): TJX Cos. reached a settlement with MasterCard Inc. in which it will pay up to $24 million to banks and other institutions to cover fraud losses stemming from a massive data breach disclosed last year. They also struck a similar deal with rival card network Visa in which it agreed to pay up to $40.9 million. As in that deal, TJX said the costs of its MasterCard settlement are included in the $256 million the company has set aside to pay for computer work and other costs associated with the breach. UPDATE (5/14/2008): The TJX Companies, Inc. today announced that it completed its previously announced settlement with MasterCard International Incorporated and its issuers. Financial institutions representing 99.5% of eligible MasterCard accounts worldwide claimed to have been affected by the unauthorized computer intrusion(s) at TJX accepted the alternative recovery offer under TJX's previously announced Settlement Agreement with MasterCard. UPDATE (8/5/2008): Eleven perpetrators allegedly involved in the hacking of nine major U.S. retailers have been charged with numerous crimes, including conspiracy, computer intrusion, fraud and identity theft. This is the largest hacking and identity theft case ever prosecuted by the U.S. Department of Justice. An indictment was returned on Aug. 5, 2008. Conspirators obtained the credit and debit card numbers by wardriving and hacking into the wireless computer networks of major retailers -- including TJX Companies, BJ's Wholesale Club, OfficeMax, Boston Market, Barnes & Noble, Sports Authority, Forever 21 and DSW. The indictments are the result of a three-year undercover investigation conducted out of the San Diego Field Office of the U.S. Secret Service. UPDATE (8/30/2008): TrustCo BankCorp NY sued TJX in August 2008 to recoup costs it incurred from reissuing an estimated 4,000 customer MasterCard debit cards after hackers accessed the TJX computer network. The bank stated its cost for the breach was up to $20 per affected account, explaining that it suffered losses from administrative expenses and lost interest and transaction fees. Later in the month, TJX in turn claimed that Trustco failed to implement policies or procedures that would have enabled the bank to avoid canceling and replacing customer debit cards. UPDATE (9/22/2008):One of the 11 people arrested last month in connection with the massive data theft at T JX Companies Inc., BJ Wholesale Clubs Inc. and several other retailers pleaded guilty yesterday to four felony counts, including wire and credit card fraud and aggravated identity theft. Many of the Internet attacks that he facilitated were SQL injection attacks, according to court documents. The stolen data was sold to cyber criminals in Eastern Europe and the U.S. or used to make fraudulent credit and debit cards. UPDATE (6/26/2009): TJX has agreed to pay $9.75 million to 41 states and to implement and maintain a comprehensive information security program, designed to safeguard consumer data and address any weaknesses in TJX's systems in place at the time of the breach. Of the $9.75 million monetary payment under the settlement, $5.5 million is to be dedicated to data protection and consumer protection efforts by the states, and $1.75 million is to reimburse the costs and fees of the investigation. Further, $2.5 million of the settlement will fund a Data Security Trust Fund to be used by the state Attorneys General to advance enforcement efforts and policy development in the field of data security and protecting consumers’ personal information. UPDATE (7/28/2009): Pennsylvania and 40 other states reached a $9.75 million settlement. UPDATE (9/4/2009): TJX settles for $525K with four banks. As part of the settlement with AmeriFirst Bank, Trustco Bank, HarborOne Credit Union and SELCO Community Credit Union, the Framingham, Mass.-based retailer paid $525,000. The money primarily will be used to cover the banks' expenses in pursuing the legal action.UPDATE (12/15/2009):A Miami hacker who had already pleaded guilty to computer fraud and identity theft for breaches at retailers T.J. Maxx, OfficeMax, and many other merchants, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to similar charges related to breaches at Heartland Payment Systems, 7-11, Hannaford Brothers supermarkets, and two other companies. Albert Gonzalez, 28, reiterated terms of a plea agreement in U.S. District Court in Boston. A week earlier, co-conspirator Stephen Watt of New York, appeared in that same court and was ordered to serve two years in prison and pay $171.5 million in restitution for developing a sniffing program used to grab payment card data in the breach at the TJX companies between 2003 and 2008. UPDATE (3/17/2010): Humza Zaman, a co-conspirator in the hack of TJX and other companies, was sentenced in Boston to 46 months in prison and fined $75,000 for his role in the conspiracy. The sentence matches what prosecutors were seeking. Zaman was charged with laundering between $600,000 and $800,000 for hacker Albert Gonzalez, who is currently awaiting sentencing on charges that he and others hacked into TJX, Office Max, Heartland Payment Systems and numerous other companies to steal data on more than 100 million credit and debit card accounts. Zaman pleaded guilty in April to one count of conspiracy. His sentence includes three years of supervised release with the condition that Zaman must disclose his conviction to any future employer. Upon release, Zaman will not be barred from using computers. Zaman is the second conspirator in the TJX case to be charged. Former Morgan Stanley coder, Stephen Watt, was sentenced in December to two years in prison for his role in the TJX case, which involved supplying Gonzalez with a sniffer program used to siphon card data from the TJX network. UPDATE (3/29/2010): A 28-year-old college dropout who became the world’s biggest credit card hacker on Thursday was sentenced to 20 years in prison for stealing millions of credit union and bank account records from TJX Cos., BJ’s Wholesale Club, Office Max, Dave & Busters, Barnes & Noble and a string of other companies – even as he was working as a $75,000-a-year undercover informant for the U.S. government in identity theft cases. But that’s not the end of it, as Albert Gonzalez is scheduled to be sentenced again to additional years behind bars for additional data thefts at Heartland Payment Systems, Hannaford Bros. supermarkets and 7-Eleven convenience stores. The theft of credit card data cost financial institutions, insurers and cardholders an estimated $200 million, according to law enforcement. JC Penney and Wet Seal were both officially added to the list of retail victims of Albert Gonzalez on Friday (March 26) when U.S. District Court Judge Douglas P. Woodlock refused to continue their cloak of secrecy and removed the seal from their names. StorefrontBacktalk had reported last August that $17 billion JC Penney chain was one of Gonzalez.s victims, even though JC Penney's media representatives were denying it. But the $561 million chain Wet Seal, which has 504 stores in 47 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, had kept their identity secret. No more and that.s the way Woodlock wanted it. UPDATE (4/16/2010): Damon Patrick Toey, the 'trusted subordinate' of TJX hacker Albert Gonzalez, was sentenced in Boston to 5 more years in prison. He also received a $100,000 fine and three years. supervised release, according to the Justice Department.UPDATE (7/8/2010): TJX has settled another lawsuit.  The Louisiana Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System, a shareholder of TJX stock, settled with TJX for $595,000 in legal fees and enhanced oversight of customer files.UPDATE (4/8/2011): Albert Gonzalez is appealing his conviction for his role in a
large data breach by claiming that his actions were authorized by the Secret
Service.  The government acknowledged that Gonzalez was a key undercover Secret Service informant at the time of the breaches.  In a 25-page petition, Gonzalez faulted one of his attorney's for failing to prepare a ""Public Authority"" defense, which would have argued that he committed crimes with the approval of government authorities.","","Dataloss DB","","100000000","2007"

This incident may be the result of a global cyberfraud operation. UPDATE (01/26/2009): Heartland Payment Systems has been sued. The lawsuit seeks damages and relief for the inexplicable delay, questionable timing, and inaccuracies concerning the disclosures with regard to the data breach, which is believed to be the largest in U.S. history. UPDATE (02/12/2009): According to BankInfoSecurity.com, the number of financial institutions that have come forward to say they have been contacted by their credit card companies Visa and MasterCard in relation to the breach has jumped from fewer than 50 to more than 200. UPDATE (06/04/2009): While it's hard to get a handle on just how many consumers were affected by the Heartland Payment Systems (HPY) data breach, the total number of institutions now reporting card compromises is at 656. UPDATE (06/16/2009): Heartland lawsuits to be heard in Texas. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation in Louisville, KY issued its decision to consolidate the class action suits. The lawsuits will be heard in the Southern District Court of Texas in Houston. Thirty-one separate lawsuits, on behalf of consumers, investors, banks and credit unions, have been filed against Princeton,N.J.-based Heartland. UPDATE (07/06/2009): Heartland Payment Systems successfully completed the first phase of an end-to-end encryption pilot project designed to enhance its security. UPDATE (08/20/2009): Albert Segvec Gonzalez has been indicted by a federal grand jury in New Jersey - along with two unnamed Russian conspirators - on charges of hacking into Heartland Payment Systems, the New Jersey-based card processing company, as well as Hannaford Brothers, 7-Eleven and two unnamed national retailers, according to the indictment unsealed Monday. Gonzalez, a former Secret Service informant, is already awaiting trial over his involvement in the TJX hack.Total records breached: 100 million transactions per month. It is unclear how many account numbers have been compromised, and how many are represented by multiple transactions. The number of records breached is an estimate, subject to revision. UPDATE (08/20/2009): According to the court document, hackers stole more than 130 million credit and debit card numbers from Heartland and Hannaford combined.UPDATE (05/12/2010): The costs to Heartland Payment Systems Inc. from the massive data breach that it disclosed in January 2009 appear to be steadily adding up. Quarterly financial results released by Heartland last week show that the card payment processor has accrued $139.4 million in breach-related expenses. The figure includes a settlement totaling nearly $60 million with Visa, another of about $3.5 million with American Express and more than $26 million in legal fees. That total also includes $42.8 million that Heartland has set aside to fund proposed settlements with several other litigants over the breach. One example of what the fund is set up for is Heartland's offer to settle several consumer class action lawsuits against it for four million. So far, Heartland has recovered about $30 million from insurance companies.UPDATE (06/02/2010): Heartland Payment Systems has made a third settlement deal, this time with MasterCard, related to a massive data breach two years ago at the card payments processor.

This incident may be the result of a global cyberfraud operation. UPDATE (01/26/2009): Heartland Payment Systems has been sued. The lawsuit seeks damages and relief for the inexplicable delay, questionable timing, and inaccuracies concerning the disclosures with regard to the data breach, which is believed to be the largest in U.S. history. UPDATE (02/12/2009): According to BankInfoSecurity.com, the number of financial institutions that have come forward to say they have been contacted by their credit card companies Visa and MasterCard in relation to the breach has jumped from fewer than 50 to more than 200. UPDATE (06/04/2009): While it's hard to get a handle on just how many consumers were affected by the Heartland Payment Systems (HPY) data breach, the total number of institutions now reporting card compromises is at 656. UPDATE (06/16/2009): Heartland lawsuits to be heard in Texas. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation in Louisville, KY issued its decision to consolidate the class action suits. The lawsuits will be heard in the Southern District Court of Texas in Houston. Thirty-one separate lawsuits, on behalf of consumers, investors, banks and credit unions, have been filed against Princeton,N.J.-based Heartland. UPDATE (07/06/2009): Heartland Payment Systems successfully completed the first phase of an end-to-end encryption pilot project designed to enhance its security. UPDATE (08/20/2009): Albert Segvec Gonzalez has been indicted by a federal grand jury in New Jersey - along with two unnamed Russian conspirators - on charges of hacking into Heartland Payment Systems, the New Jersey-based card processing company, as well as Hannaford Brothers, 7-Eleven and two unnamed national retailers, according to the indictment unsealed Monday. Gonzalez, a former Secret Service informant, is already awaiting trial over his involvement in the TJX hack.Total records breached: 100 million transactions per month. It is unclear how many account numbers have been compromised, and how many are represented by multiple transactions. The number of records breached is an estimate, subject to revision. UPDATE (08/20/2009): According to the court document, hackers stole more than 130 million credit and debit card numbers from Heartland and Hannaford combined.UPDATE (05/12/2010): The costs to Heartland Payment Systems Inc. from the massive data breach that it disclosed in January 2009 appear to be steadily adding up. Quarterly financial results released by Heartland last week show that the card payment processor has accrued $139.4 million in breach-related expenses. The figure includes a settlement totaling nearly $60 million with Visa, another of about $3.5 million with American Express and more than $26 million in legal fees. That total also includes $42.8 million that Heartland has set aside to fund proposed settlements with several other litigants over the breach. One example of what the fund is set up for is Heartland's offer to settle several consumer class action lawsuits against it for four million. So far, Heartland has recovered about $30 million from insurance companies.UPDATE (06/02/2010): Heartland Payment Systems has made a third settlement deal, this time with MasterCard, related to a massive data breach two years ago at the card payments processor. As part of the deal, Heartland has agreed to pay as much as US$41.1 million to MasterCard issuers that lost money as a result of the data breach. The deal is contingent on financial institutions representing 80 percent of the affected MasterCard accounts accepting the offer by June 25.

Plaintiffs in the suit are claiming that Netflix has “perpetrated the largest voluntary privacy breach to date.” According to the Complaint, Netflix knowingly and voluntarily disclosed the sensitive and personal information of approximately 480,000 Netflix subscribers when Netflix provided participants in a contest initiated to improve Netflix’s movie recommendation systems with data sets containing over 100 million subscriber movie ratings and preferences. Netflix has claimed that the data sets provided to the contest participants were anonymized and that the subscribers’ movie ratings were accompanied only by “a numeric identifier unique to the subscriber” (as opposed to the subscriber’s name or other personal information). However, the complaint cites the results of several researchers who, in fact, were able to crack Netflix’s anonymization process and identify individual subscribers.","","Media","","","2010"

Experts predict the numbers could climb even higher than 70 million once the company completes its investigation. UPDATE (1/13/2014): Target Corp. has confirmed that malware was found on the Point of Sale devices. The malware has been removed. The number of individuals affected are now said to be 110 million individuals, 70 million more than originally thought.UPDATE (1/13/2014): Security experts are stating that Target may not be alone in the data breach. Neiman Marcus and at least 3 other unnamed retailers (these retailers are thought to be located in Eastern Europe) may also have been compromised as federal investigators track what they believe to be an international crime ring.

""The malware is a memory-scraping tool that grabs card data directly from point-of-sale terminals and then stores it on the victims system for later retrieval"". The malware was originally thought to have been developed in Russia, known as BlackPOS. This new version is considered to be highly customized so that current anitvirus programs would not have detected it as reported by investigative agencies.UPDATE (1/20/2014): ""A 17 year-old Russian national from St. Petersburg is thought to be responsible for the malicious programming that allowed for data from Target and Neiman Marcus to be compromised,"" according to a California based security firm.UPDATE (1/21/2014): Two Mexican citizens were arrested at the border in South Texas for the purchase of thousands of dollars worth of merchandise with information stolen during the Target security breach, as reported by a South Texas police chief.A spokesman with the Secret Service announced that the investigation is ongoing into the possibility of a link between the Target breach and the two arrested in Texas.

 financial and personal data used credentials alledgedly  were stolen from a 
heating and air conditioning subcontractor in Pennsylvania, according to
 digital security journalist Brian Krebs.It appears as though the air conditioning company was given access to Target's 
computer network in order for the vendor to make remote changes to the system to  cut heating and cooling costs. Target has not confirmed the accuracy of this report.UPDATE (2/6/2014): Target Corporation announced they are fast tracking new credit card security technology in their stores, 6 months earlier than originally planned. Target's CFO announced it is moving up its goal to utilize chip-enabled smart cards, 
and now plans to have them in stores by early 2015. These cards encrypt point of sale data,
 rendering the credit card number less useful if stolen. Currently this technology is more prevalent outide of the US, but have resulted in 
lower card number thefts in other countries, notably Canada and the 
United Kingdom.UPDATE (2/15/2014): The breach at the Target Copr. that exposed credit card and personal data on more than 110 million consumers appears to have begun with a malware-laced email phishing attack sent to employees at the HVAC contractor Fazio Mechanical in Sharpsburg Pennsylvania.

The company has notified any customer who used the site from June 3, 2012 through April 30, 2013 that their credit card may have been used fraudulently.  Originally the company was contacted by Discover Card requesting an investigation due to some unauthorized charges experienced by Discover cards customers. The company completed their own investigation and on February 27, 2013 learned that a small number of Visa customers had also experienced unauthorized charges. On March 6, 2013 Mastercard also contacted the company regarding fraudulent charges against their credit card holders.The company hired a forensic investigator who discovered that the company had been a victim of a cyber attack that gained access to and installed malware on their website server in eary June 2012. Their anitvirus and malware scans did not detect the malware. April 3, 2013 the company notified approximately 3,503 customers of the breach. This is the amount that was reported to the company by the credit card companies.  On April 22, 2013, the company received a report from the forensic investigator that 2,598 credit cards were compromised. On April 30, 2013 the company received calls from two customers stating that their cards had been compromised. The company investigated those customers' complaints and reported the issue to the Secret Service. The Secret Service asked the company to not provide any additional notice until their investigation had been completed.The Secret Service investigation uncovered that the hackers had set up an unauthorized email account that captured the company's credit card transactions without their knowledge. The Secret Service could not definitely say who the hacker or hackers were. Based on the information the company received, they believed it to be a former high level employee who has since died.   ","","California Attorney General","","3503","2012"
